# ConnectHealth


**ConnectHealth** is a secure and efficient platform designed to help hospitals manage patient data while ensuring data security and fostering collaboration between healthcare providers. The platform is powered by **Ruff**, an AI assistant that helps doctors make informed decisions on medications, treatments, and patient care protocols.

## Why This Project Was Created

The healthcare industry often struggles with challenges related to data security, management, and interoperability between hospitals. **ConnectHealth** was created to address these challenges by:

2. **Improving Hospital Collaboration**: Many hospitals face difficulties sharing patient information across different facilities. ConnectHealth connects hospitals on a unified platform, allowing seamless and secure sharing of patient data.
3. **Introducing AI-Assisted Decision Making**: The integration of **Ruff**, our AI assistant, helps healthcare professionals by offering real-time suggestions on medications and treatments, speeding up decision-making and improving patient outcomes.
4. **Simplifying Data Management**: ConnectHealth offers an easy-to-use interface that allows healthcare providers to manage medical records, prescriptions, and financial information efficiently, reducing administrative overhead and ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations.

# Ruff: Your Friendly Medical Assistant üê∂

Ruff is a helpful and interactive feature designed to assist healthcare professionals with quick access to patient data and medical advice. Built using React, Firebase, and Axios, Ruff operates through a chat interface where users can type commands to retrieve specific information or get advice.

### Key Features:

- **Find Patient Information**: With the command `find {user name}`, Ruff will search the database for a patient‚Äôs personal details such as name, date of birth, allergies, address, and phone number.
  
- **Retrieve Medical Records**: Use the command `medical {user name}` to pull up patient records, including prescription history and the total number of medical visits.

- **Access Patient Profile URL**: Ruff can provide a direct link to the patient's profile by using the command `go to {user name}`. This makes navigating patient records easier.

- **General Commands**: Typing `help` will display a list of available commands and how Ruff can assist you with medical advice or patient data retrieval.

### Example Commands:
- `find John Doe`: Fetches personal data for John Doe.
- `medical Jane Doe`: Retrieves medical records, including prescriptions and visits.
- `go to John Doe`: Returns a URL for John Doe‚Äôs profile page.
